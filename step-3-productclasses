Write derived product classes: Book, Clothing and Movie implementing the 
keywords() which returns the appropriate keywords to index the product, 
displayString() [to create a string that contains the product info] and 
dump() [that outputs the database format of the product info]. 

We recommend trying to compile (NOT test, just compile) each of these files as you write them to avoid solving the same compile issue 3 times for each derived class. Remember you can easily compile by using the -c flag (e.g. $ g++ -g -Wall -std=c++11 -c book.cpp ). Each class should be written in its own .h and .cpp files (i.e. book.h, book.cpp, clothing.h, etc.)
